  When the EDN files are read, a set of reader macros are enabled to allow for some

  :additional-files
  : A seq of absolute file paths that, if they exist, will be loaded last, after all
    normal resources.
    This is typically used to provide an editable (outside the classpath) file for final
    production configuration overrides.

  :overrides
  : A map of configuration data that is overlayed (using a deep merge)
    on the configuration data read from the files, before validation and coercion.

  :profiles
  : A seq of keywords that identify which profiles should be loaded and in what order.
    The default is an empty list.  [[configure-using]] will provide default
    profiles based on the config key specified by [[with-config-spec]].

  :properties
  : An optional map of additional properties that may be substituted (using
    the `#config/prop` reader macro). Explicit properties have higher precendence than JVM
    system properties, which have higher precendence than environment
    variables; however the convention is that environment variable names
    are all upper case, and properties are all lower case, so actual conflicts
    should not occur.
  : The keys of the properties map are converted to strings via `name`, so they
    may be strings or symbols, or more frequently, keywords.
  : Most often the properties map is used for specific overrides in testing, or
    to expose some bit of configuration that cannot be directly extracted
    from environment variables or JVM system properties.

  :variants
  : The variants searched for, for each profile.
  : [[default-variants]] provides the default list of variants.  A nil variant
    is always prefixed on the provided list.

  :resource-path
  : A function that builds resource paths from profile and variant.
  : The default is [[default-resource-path]], but this could be overridden
    to (for example), use a directory structure to organize configuration files
    rather than splitting up the different components of the name using dashes.

  Any additional files are loaded after all profile and variant files.

  The contents of each file are deep-merged together; later files override earlier files.
