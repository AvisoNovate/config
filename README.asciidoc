== Config - Smart and flexible system configuration

Config is a very small library used to handle configuration of a server; it works
quite well with a system defined in terms of
link:https://github.com/stuartsierra/component[Stuart Sierra's component library].

link:https://medium.com/@hlship/microservices-configuration-and-clojure-4f6807ef9bea[This posting] provides
a lot of detail on the requirements and capabilities of config.

Config reads a series of files, primarily from the classpath.
The files contain contain configuration data, in either
link:http://yaml.org/[YAML] or
link:https://github.com/edn-format/edn[EDN] format.

The files are read in a specific order, based on a set of _profiles_.
The name of the file to read is based on the profile.

The contents of all the files are converted to Clojure maps (with keyword keys) and are
deep-merged together.

Meanwhile, a set of
link:https://github.com/Prismatic/schema[schemas] are merged together, and used to validate and coerce
the data read from the individual configuration files.

The intent of profiles is that there is an approximate mapping between components and profiles.
Each component will provide a schema (for validation and coercion) and profiles are used to ensure
the correct configuration data is read.

But what about the
link:http://12factor.net/config[12 Factor App]'s guideline to store configuration only as environment
variables?
This is embraced by config, because the files may contain environment variable references that are expanded
at runtime, before parsing of the file content.

At link:http://www.aviso.io/[Aviso], we use these features in a number of ways.
For example, for quick testing we combine a number of microservices (each of which
has its own configuration profile and schema) together into a single system, and specify a large set of profiles.
Meanwhile, in production (on AWS) we can build a smaller system with a single microservice, and single profile.
We can also provide an additional configuration file that enables configuration overrides based on environment variables
set by CloudFormation.

When used with component, each component will have a keyword that will be used as a top-level key
in the merged configuration, and as a configuration profile.

For example, you might define a web service as:

[source,clojure]
----
(defrecord WebService [configuration request-handler jetty-instance]

  component/Lifecycle

  (start [this]
    (assoc :jetty-instance (jetty/run-jetty
                              request-handler
                              {:port (get-in configuration [:web-service :port])
                               :join? false})))

  (stop [this]
    (.stop jetty-instance)
    this))

(s/defschema WebServiceConfig
  {:web-service {:port s/Int}})

(defn new-web-service
  []
  (-> (map->WebService {})
      (component/using [:configuration :request-handler])
      (config/with-config-schema WebServiceConfig)))
----

You would also provide a default configuration file, `web-service-configuration.yaml`:

[source,clojure]
----
web-service:
  port: 8080
----

And finally, build and start a system from all this:

[source,clojure]
----
(-> (component/system-map
      :web-service (new-web-service)
      :request-handler (new-request-handler))
    (config/extend-system-map {:profiles [:web-service]})
    component/start-system)
----

But what if you want to override part of the :web-service configuration?

This can be accomplished in a number of ways:

- By supplying a `configuration.yaml` file (this corresponds to the nil profile,
  which is loaded last).
- By supplying a `web-service-local-configuration.yaml` file (because the :local
  variant is loaded *after* the default variant).
- By providing direct overrides to the configuration using the :overrides option
  key.
- By supplying an `override-configuration.yaml' file, and setting the
  :profile option key to [:web-service :override].
- By supplying additional files (on the file system, not the classpath)
  to load using the :additional-files option key.

Config is easily extensible to override how configuration files are named, and to support new formats
of configuration files (by adding new extensions and parsers).

Config is available under the terms of the Apache Software License 2.0.
